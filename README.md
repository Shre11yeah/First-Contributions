## Introduction
## Guidelines:

- **No DELETING files** 
- Your code doesn't have to be pretty
- You have the freedom to use any programming language.
- If there is no folder for the Programming Language YOU are using, please create a folder inside the **"HacktoberFest"** directory with the name of the language.
- Enjoy the coding process!

Whether you're a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest encourages participation in giving back to the open-source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source projects. In its 10th year, Hacktoberfest continues to grow and foster a vibrant open source community that we are all a part of.

## How Does It Work?

- First sign up on the Hacktoberfest site anytime between September 26 and October 31.
- To qualify for digital swags, you must register and make four pull requests between October 1-31.
- You can contribute to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

## Rules

To earn your tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 in any time zone. Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

## How Can I Contribute?

Contributions aren't limited to code – we welcome contributions to documentation, design, translations, bug reports and more! If you're new to open source or interested in contributing, this repository is a great place to start. If you're an experienced open-source contributor, feel free to check out these issues and contribute.
